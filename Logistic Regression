3. Logistic regression
A supervised machine learning algorithm in Python that is used in estimating discrete values in binary, e.g: 0/1, yes/no, true/false. This is based on a set of independent variables. This algorithm is used to predict the probability of an event’s occurrence by fitting that data into a logistic curve or logistic function. This is why it is also called logistic regression. 

Logistic regression, also called as Sigmoid function, takes in any real valued number and then maps it to a value that falls between 0 and 1. This algorithm finds its use in finding spam emails, website or ad click predictions and customer churn.

Sigmoid Function is defined as, 

f(x) = L / 1+e^(-x)

x: domain of real numbers

L: curve’s max value
