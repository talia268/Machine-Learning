4. kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)
This is a Python Machine Learning algorithms for classification and regression- mostly for classification. This is a supervised learning algorithm that considers different centroids and uses a usually Euclidean function to compare distance. Then, it analyzes the results and classifies each point to the group to optimize it to place with all closest points to it. It classifies new cases using a majority vote of k of its neighbors. The case it assigns to a class is the one most common among its K nearest neighbors. For this, it uses a distance function.
